<h1>Specfile</h1>
<p>
The Singularity specfile is designed around the notion of packaging, so some
packaging standards have been leveraged. The specfile tells Singularity what
components from the host operating system should be included and packaged into
the Singularity Application (SAPP) container. This format is also young and
more features will be included as they become needed. At present the specfile
is divided into two areas: tags (key-value pairs which are usually for header
information) and sections. Both are defined below:
<h2>Key/Value Tags</h2>
<p>
All Tags must be defined above any sections, so they are usually found at the
top of the specfile. They have the format "KEY: VALUE" (key name followed by a
colon, then a single space and a single line value string). Valid tag names are
defined below:
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Name:</strong>
Define the name of the SAPP pacakge. If this is omitted then the name is
derived from the name of the specfile.
<br/>
<em>
note: this should not have spaces or other non-file name happy characters.
</em>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Maintainer:</strong>
The free form name and email address of the SAPP maintainer or developer that
created and maintains this package.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Exec:</strong>
The primary binary or script that will be exec'ed when this SAPP envrionment
is run.
<br/>
<em>
note: If this tag is omitted, you must define a %runscript section!
</em>
</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h2>Sections</h2>
<p>
Sections (unlike tags) are meant for multi-line information and are all prefixed
with a '%' (percent sign). The section will include all following lines until
either the end of the file or the next section. Supported section names are as
follows:
<ul>
<li>
<strong>%files</strong>
This should be a list of all files from the host operating system that should be
bundled into the SAPP envrionment. All of the programs, data, configurations, and
files that you need to run should be listed. One line per file (globs supported).
</li>
<li>
<strong>%runscript</strong>
The runscript is the driver which gets exec'ed when the SAPP bundle is run. Iff
you have defined an "Exec:" declaration above, then by default this written for
you. Using this feature, you can either rewrite the default behavior or if you
have chosen not to define "Exec:" then this section would be required. This
section will be executed as a shell script within the SAPP envrionment (container)
thus standard shell syntax is not only supported but required.
</li>
</ul>
