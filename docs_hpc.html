<h1>Singularity in an HPC Environment</h1>
<p>
One of the architecturly defined features in Singularity is that it can execute
containers like they are native programs or scripts on a host computer. As a
result, integration with schedulers is simple and runs exactly as you would
expect. All standard input, output, error, pipes, IPC, and other communication
pathways that locally running progams employ are syncronized with the applications
running locally within the container.
</p>
<p>
Additionally because Singularity is not emulating a full hardware level
virtulization paradigm, there is no need to seperate out any sandboxed networks
or file systems because there is no concept of user-escalation within a container.
Users can run Singularity containers just as they run any other program on the
HPC resource.
</p>
<p>
Another result of the Singularity architecture is the ability to properly integrate
with the Message Passing Interface (MPI). Work has already been done for out of the
box compatibility with Open MPI (both in Open MPI v2.x as well as part of
Singularity). Here is a document that illustrates the Open MPI/Singularity workflow:
</p>

<p>
From the above image you can follow the invocation pathway:
<ol>
<li>mpirun is called by the resource manager or the user directly from a shell</li>
<li>Open MPI then calls the process management daemon (ORTED)</li>
<li>The ORTED process launches the Singularity container requested by the mpirun command</li>
<li>Singularity builds the container and namespace environment</li>
<li>Singularity then launches the MPI application within the container</li>
<li>The MPI application launches and loads the Open MPI libraries</li>
<li>The Open MPI libraries connect back to the ORTED process via the Process Management Interface (PMI)</li>
</ol>
At this point the processes within the container run as they would normally directly
on the host at full bandwidth! This entire process happens behind the scenes, and
from the user's perspective running via MPI is as simple as just calling mpirun as
they would normally:
