Singularity creates a new application distribution paradigm by
utilizing a combination of both packaging and container ideas and
maintaining the historical precendent of standardized workflows.

<h1>About Singularity</h1>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>
Software development on Linux is moving in a new direction. Thanks to
advances in virtualization and container technologies, developers are
finding it very convient to distribute instances of their
build/development envrionment in addition or instead of source code
alone. There are some benefits and drawbacks to this model.
</p>
<p>
Some of the benefits of distributing software in this fashion include
being able to provide a configuration free implementation which can
easily be replicated to distribute a software or workflow. The user
does not need to worry about managing potentially complicated
dependency chains nor worry about configuration nuances. But the
drawback are numerous and tend to focus on two major ares. To achieve
a portable environment the container is usually a complete operating
system image. This means the overhead involved with management and
distribution is far from neglidgable (e.g. size, security, updates,
trust, etc.). Additionally containers and virtual machines may not
fit a standardized workflow that requires command line usage without
root escalation.
</p>

<h2>The Solution</h2>
<p>
Singularity is a package build and run-time environment designed to
achieve portable application (Singularity Application / SAPP)
packages which can be then run on any Linux system without ever
having to worry about portability or dependencies. SAPP packages
never need to be installed, and can be executed directly at
run-time as either a contained environment or used like any standard
Linux program!
</p>

<h2>Portability</h2>
<p>
A Singularity Application (SAPP) is a package bundle which contains
within it all of the required dependencies necessary to run. It is
like having a statically compiled binary which can be distributed
easily from system to system without concern of even the C library
compatibility.


The SAPP
can contain anything from a simple binary executable to an entire
pipeline or work flow of multiple applications. There could be
multiple services which can be run within the SAPP environment and
interaction with the SAPP file is fully configurable. For example
in the simple configuration you may choose to emulate the program
arguments so it operates just like running the application directly. 
</p>

<h2>Reproducibility</h2>
<p>
Each SAPP includes all of the application's necessary run-time
libraries and can even include the required data and files for a
particular application to run. This encapsulation of the entire
user-space environment facilitates not only portability but also
reproducibility.
</p>

<p>
Singularity is released under a modified BSD license. The only modification
being that you may not use the name's of any project members or contributors
(namely UC or the US Department of Energy) to endorse or promote products or
