<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>
The goal with Singularity is to build a container system which completely
abstracts out the container so it virtually doesn't exist. Simplify the
interface such that the container environment is no longer a consideration.
A good example implementation of this is how Apple's OS X deals with
application bundles. Installing an application is as easy as obtaining
an OS X "app" (which is actually a directory of a particular format). This
application bundle directory can then be executed by double clicking it
anywhere within the Finder interface (it is recommended to copy them to a
common location by dragging them to the /Applications directory).
</p>
<p>
Singularity provides both the run-time environment and also the build tools.
</p>

<h2>Building the SAPP</h2>
<p>
The process of building/creating a Singularity Application (SAPP) container
starts with defining a Singularity specfile. The specfile resembles a
standard packaging format (RPM in-particular) and works in a similar manner
to a packaging technology. The role of the specfile is to determine what
files would go into the final SAPP package and what the SAPP container will
do when it is executed.
</p>
<p>
The build process will automatically resolve dependencies (as it can), but
it is always safest to assume you must manually specify all binaries,
configuration files, data, and operating system dependencies that are
non-standard.
</p>
<p>
Singularity will take the defined files, all files that it probed which
are dependencies, as well as other standard and necessary files and bundle
them up into a format which Singularity can then execute at run-time.
</p>
<p>
More information about the specfile can be found on the
<a href="docs_specfile.html">documentation page for the specfile</a>.
</p>

<h2>Run-time</h2>
<p>
Singularity is designed to run containers like any other application on the
system. When it is invoked, it begins a chain of events that checks the SAPP
file, and explodes the contents of the container to disk. A very important
note is that all of these actions are done as the user who is running
Singularity. Every file inside the container is owned by the correct user,
and never root! This is very important as normal escalation pathways require
root owned files. The container files are cached in the user's home directory
(which is soon to be configurable) based on the container name and checksum
of the SAPP file.
</p>
<p>
At this point, the commands, arguments, IO and pipes are all passed to the
Singularity container execution engine which is responsible for calling the
change root (chroot()) system call and thus moving the top of the file system
from the host's root ('/'), to the container's root ('/') which allows the
applications running within the container to satisfy all dependencies
solely within the container. This puts the container itself temporarily along
side the host operating system as it executes the applications which exist
therein.
</p>
<p>
This can be illustrated as follows:<br/>

</p>
<h2>Access to files</h2>
<p>
File system access outside the container is provided and managed via a file
descriptor to the current working directory where Singularity was initially
called. Any paths which are thus defined relative to the starting directory
will properly resolve without the need to provide any additional mount layers
(e.g. a bind mount).
</p>
<p>
Because of how Singularity handles relative paths, it is very easy to make use
of specialized file systems (e.g. very high speed data IO or archive storage)
by simply starting in or pointing at the directory from the relative starting
point. This manner of operation also puts no additional latency, bottlenecks,
or other interference with IO which may affect performance.
</p>
<p>
Fully qualified paths would always resolve internally to the container. This
is the fundamental mechanism to containers and necessary for applications to
operate and resolve dependencies within the container-ed environment.
</p>
<p>
The architecture as you can see is specifically designed to inter-operate both
inside and outside of the container, but there is a feature that will be
included at some point which will lock the container so it can not be escaped
or have any interaction with the host system. This could be very useful for
running test environments, network services, or when you just wish to keep
the contained environment contained!
