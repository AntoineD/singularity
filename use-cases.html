<h1>Use Cases / Examples</h1>
<p>
Work in progress... stay tuned.
</p>
<h3>Reproducable science</h3>
<p>
Singularity containers can be built to include all of the programs, libraries,
data and scripts such that an entire demonstration can be contained and either
archived or distributed for others to replicate no matter what version of Linux
they are presently running.
</p>

<h3>Commercially supported code requiring a particular environment</h3>
<p>
Some commercial applications are only certified to run on particular versions
of Linux. If that application was installed into a Singularity container running
the version of Linux that it is certified for, that container could run on any
Linux host. The application environment, libraries, and certified stack would all
continue to run exactly as it is intended.
</p>
<p>
Additionally, Singularity blurs the line between container and host such that 
your home directory (and other directories) exist within the container.
Applications within the container have full and direct access to all files you
own thus you can easily incorporate the contained commerical application into
your work and process flow on the host.
</p>

<h3>Static environments (software appliances)</h3>
<p>

</p>

<h3>Legacy code on old operating systems</h3>
<p>

</p>

<h3>Complicated software stacks that are very host specific</h3>
<p>

</p>

<h3>Complicated workflows that require custom installation and/or data</h3>
<p>

</p>

<h3>Customized development envrionments</h3>
<p>

</p>
