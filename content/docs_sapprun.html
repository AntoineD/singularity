<h1>Executing a SAPP container</h1>
<p>
There are two mechanisms for launching a SAPP container. The first you can
execute the SAPP file directly or you can launch the SAPP through the
Singularity <em>run</em> command. In either case, all arguments passed to
the container will be passed through Singularity and directly given to the
container's runscript driver (%runscript).
</p>
<h2>Running a SAPP container directly</h2>
<p>
Each SAPP file is built with a Singularity wrapper as an interpreter so when
executed the shell understands that Singularity should be used to execute
this application. For most cases, there is no need to run the full
Singularity command just to execute a SAPP container, but it does give you
debugging and possibly future feature options above and beyond the default.
</p>
<p>
It is important to note that while the SAPP file is executable, it *requires*
Singularity to be installed for it to be able to run!
</p>
<h2>Using Singularity to run a SAPP container</h2>
<p>
You can also use Singularity itself to launch the container. Benefits to doing
this are additional Singularity options and features (e.g. <em>--debug</em>).
This should be done as follows:
</p>
<pre>
$ singularity run /path/to/singularity/file.sapp [arguments]
</pre>


</p>
