<h1>Introduction to Singularity usage and syntax</h1>
<h2>The Singularity command</h2>
<p>
Singularity uses a primary command wrapper called 'singularity'. When you run
'singularity' without any options or arguments it will dump the high level
usage syntax.
</p>
<p>
The general usage form is:
<pre>
$ singularity (opts1) [subcommand] (opts2) ...
</pre>
</p>

<h2>Options and argument processing</h2>
<p>
Because of the nature of how Singularity cascades commands and subcommands,
argument processing is done with a mandatory order. This means that where you
place arguments is important! In the above usage form example, <strong>opts1</strong>
are the global Singularity runtime options. These options are always
applicable no matter what subcommand you select (e.g. --verbose or --debug). But
subcommand specific options must be passed after the relevent subcommand.
</p>
<p>
To further clarify this example, the 'exec' Singularity subcommand will execute a
program within the container and pass the arguments passed to the program. So to
mitigate any argument clashes, Singularity must not intrepret or interfere with
any of the command arguments or options that are not relevent for that particular
function.
