<h1>Singularity</h1>
<h2>Application containers enabling mobility of compute</h2>
<h3>Encapsulation of the environment</h3>
<p>
Mobility of Compute is the encapsulation of an environment in such a
manner to make it portable between systems. This operating system
environment can contain the necessary applications for a particular
work-flow, development tools, and/or raw data. Once this environment has
been developed it can be easily copied and run from any other Linux
system.
</p>
<h3>The Singularity image</h3>
<p>
Singularity implements this by using an image file which contains a
particular operating system environment. Once you have configured this
environment as needed, you can copy this file to any other Linux system
that has Singularity installed, and you can execute programs within this
container or launch an interactive shell and use that container
environment as if you were logged into it.
</p>
<h3>No user contextual changes</h3>
<p>
Additionally you can do this without super user access or any root owned
daemon processes, as a non-privileged user. Singularity also limits the
ability to achieve user escalation from within a container. A user outside
the container, is the same user inside the container! These features makes
implementation on shared/multi-tenant resources as simple as installing
Singularity!
</p>
<h3>BYOE: Bring Your Own Environment</h3>
<p>
From a user's perspective, we can BYOE anywhere that Singularity is
installed. From a service providers perspective we can easily allow users
the flexibility of "cloud" like environments to enable their requirements.
</p>
<h3>Support of developmental environments</h3>
<p>
There is always a misalignment between development and production
environments. The service provider can only offer a stable, secure tuned
production environment which in many times will not keep up with the fast
paced requirements of developers. With Singularity, you can control your own
development environment and simply copy them to the production resources.
