<h2>Application containers enabling mobility of compute</h2>
<p>
<b>What is Mobility of Compute?</b>
</p>
<p>
Mobility of Compute is the encapsulation of a system environment in such
a manner to make it portable between systems. The operating system
environment can contain the necessary applications for a particular
work-flow, development tools, and/or raw data. Once this environment has
been developed it can be easily copied and run from any other Linux
system.
</p>
<p>
Singularity implements this by using an image file which contains a
particular operating system environment. Once you have configured this
environment as needed, you can copy this file to any other Linux system
that has Singularity installed, and you can execute programs within this
container or launch an interactive shell and use that container
environment as if you were logged into it.
</p>
<p>
Additionally you can do this without super user access or any root owned
daemon processes, as a non-privileged user. Singularity also limits the
ability to achieve user escalation from within a container. These features
makes implementation on shared/multi-tenant resources as simple as installing
Singularity!
</p>
<p>
From a user's perspective, we can "Bring Their Own Environment" (BYOE)
anywhere that Singularity is installed. From a service providers perspective
we can easily allow users the flexibility of "cloud" like environments to
enable their requirements.
