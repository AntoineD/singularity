<h2>Enabling Mobility of Compute</h2>
<p>
<b>What is Mobility of Compute?</b>
</p>
<p>
Mobility of Compute is the encapsulation of a system environment in such
a manner to make it portable between systems. The operating system
environment can contain the necessary applications for a particular
work-flow, development tools, and/or raw data. Once this environment has
been developed it can be easily copied and run from any other Linux
system.
</p>
<p>
Singularity implements this by using an image file which contains a
particular environment. Once you have configured this environment as
needed, you can copy this file to any other Linux system that has
Singularity installed, and you can execute programs within this container
or launch an interactive shell and use that container environment as if
it was the system you just logged into. Additionally you can do this
without super user access or any root owned daemon processes which makes
implementation on shared/multi-tenant resources as simple as installing
any other package or program.
</p>
<p>
Using this model, you can always work in your Linux environment of
choice, and easily integrate contained applications into a given work
flow (e.g. batch schedulers, scripts, pipelines, etc.).
