<h2>Contributions</h2>
<p>
There is some added verbiage for developers who are contributing to the
project which stipulates that nobody is required to make any changes public,
but if someone does, and they do not directly specify a license to their
contribution, then all contributions default to being compatible with the
BSD license with regards to distribution and redistribution.
</p>
<p>
The legal wording is as follows:

<pre>
You are under no obligation whatsoever to provide any bug fixes, patches, or
upgrades to the features, functionality or performance of the source code
("Enhancements") to anyone; however, if you choose to make your Enhancements
available either publicly, or directly to Lawrence Berkeley National
Laboratory, without imposing a separate written license agreement for such
Enhancements, then you hereby grant the following license: a  non-exclusive,
royalty-free perpetual license to install, use, modify, prepare derivative
works, incorporate into other computer software, distribute, and sublicense
such enhancements or derivative works thereof, in binary and source code form.
</pre>
