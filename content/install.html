<h2>Build From Source</h2>
<p>
Presently, Singularity is only available in source code form and can only
be compiled and run on Linux systems. To obtain and compile the code, do
the following:
<pre>
$ git clone -b master --single-branch https://github.com/gmkurtzer/singularity.git
$ cd singularity
$ sh ./autogen.sh
$ ./configure --prefix=/usr/local
$ make
$ sudo make install
</pre>

note: The 'make install' is required to be run as root to get a properly installed
Singularity implementation. If you do not run it as root, you will only be able to
launch Singularity as root due to permission limitations.

<h2>Build an RPM From Source</h2>
Like the above, you can build an RPM of Singularity so it can be more easily
managed, upgraded and removed. To obtain, compile and build the RPM do the
following:
<pre>
$ git clone -b master --single-branch https://github.com/gmkurtzer/singularity.git
$ cd singularity
$ sh ./autogen.sh
$ make dist
$ rpmbuild -ta singularity-*.tar.gz
$ sudo yum install ~/rpmbuild/RPMS/*/singularity-[0-9]*.rpm
</pre>
