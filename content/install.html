<h2>Build From Source</h2>
<p>
Presently, Singularity is only available in source code form and can only
be compiled and run on Linux systems. To obtain and compile the code, do
the following:
<pre>
$ git clone -b master --single-branch https://github.com/gmkurtzer/singularity.git
$ cd singularity
$ sh ./autogen.sh
$ ./configure --prefix=/usr/local
$ make
$ sudo make install
</pre>

note: The 'make install' is required to be run as root to get a properly installed
Singularity implementation. If you do not run it as root, you will only be able to
launch Singularity as root due to permission limitations.
</p>
<br/>

<h2>Build an RPM From Source</h2>
<p>
Like the above, you can build an RPM of Singularity so it can be more easily
managed, upgraded and removed. To obtain, compile and build the RPM do the
following:
<pre>
$ git clone -b master --single-branch https://github.com/gmkurtzer/singularity.git
$ cd singularity
$ sh ./autogen.sh
$ make dist
$ rpmbuild -ta singularity-*.tar.gz
$ sudo yum install ~/rpmbuild/RPMS/*/singularity-[0-9]*.rpm
</pre>
<p>
Note: if you want to have the RPM install the files to an alternative location,
you should define the environment variable 'PREFIX' to suit your needs, and use
the following command to build:
</p>
<pre>
$ PREFIX=/opt/singularity
$ rpmbuild -ta --define="_prefix $PREFIX" --define "_sysconfdir $PREFIX/etc" --define "_defaultdocdir $PREFIX/share" singularity-*.tar.gz
</pre>
