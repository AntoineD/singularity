        <h1>Singularity</h1>
<p>
Singularity is a package building and runtime environment built to
achieve portable application bundles which can be then run on any
Linux system without ever having to worry about portability.
</p>

<p>
There are several methods to implement portable application stacks
at present. Among them are containers and virtual machines. But when
using these solutions to package a single application (or application
stack), one ends up having to manage the entire operating system
overhead as well (this includes security, updates, the size overhead,
etc..) just to distribute a single application or workflow. While
virtual machines and containers have very strong usage benefits,
application portability and distribution is not an effecient use of
these technologies.
</p>

<p>
Singularity works on a completely different premis. Contrary to
building and managing an entire operating system environment to
distribute a custom application, configuration or demonstration,
Singularity packages all of the required dependencies and creates an
executable package that can be distributed easily, safely, and
reliably.
</p>

<h2>Portability</h2>
<p>
A Singularity Application (SAPP) is a package bundle which contains
within it all of the required depdencies necessary to run. The SAPP
can contain anything from a simple binary executible to an entire
pipeline or workflow of multiple applications. There could be
multiple services which can be run within the SAPP environment and
interaction with the SAPP file is fully configurable. For example
in the simple configuration you may choose to emulate the program
arguments so it operates just like running the application directly. 
</p>

<h2>Security</h2>

<h2>Reproducibility</h2>

<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>
<pre>
$ cd ~
$ cat find.spec
program /usr/bin/find
$ singularity-build find.spec
   ...
WROTE: find.sapp
$ singularity find.sapp . -maxdepth 1 -name \*.sapp
./find.sapp
</pre>
