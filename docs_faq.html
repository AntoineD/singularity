The goal of Singularity is to run a contained application as if it did not
exist inside of a container. This means you want the contained application
to run as if it existed on the host system! Namespace virtualization does
the opposite, it segregates the contents of the container from the host.
</p>
<p>
There is a feature request to optionally provide that layer of seperation
both for testing and use cases which may require containment.

<h2>How does Singularity relate/differ from Shifter?</h2>
<p>
NERSC (like most HPC centers) are feeling the pressure from users asking
for support for containers, specifically Docker. Due to the architecture
of Docker it is very difficult (if not impossible) to properly and
securely implement in a multi-user HPC environment. Shifter is NERSC's
implementation to provide a Docker front-end interface to a non-Docker
backend which integrates with the scheduler to provide a contiguous
workflow and integration.
</p>
<p>
Singularity on the other hand does not leverage the Docker workflow or
front end at all. Singularity works on a very different premise. Instead
of packaging the entire operating system to support a single application
or workflow/pipeline Docker only packages what it needs, and wraps that
into an application that can be interacted on like any other program on
the system. For example, there is no need to integrate it into a
scheduler or make any system changes because it can be run like any other
application. This means it can simply be called by the user within a
batch submission script.
